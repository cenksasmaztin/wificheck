#PURPOSE of this SCRIPT

Overview

This Python script is designed to monitor and analyze the performance of Wi-Fi networks in real-time. It collects various metrics, such as signal strength, SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), data rates, throughput, and network performance indicators like ping times, DHCP, DNS, and authentication status. The tool displays results in a tabular format on the terminal and generates a summary report with a graphical visualization saved as a PDF.

Features

	•	Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously collects and displays Wi-Fi performance data.
	•	Network Performance Metrics: Measures signal strength, SNR, data rates, throughput, and latency (gateway and internet ping).
	•	Connectivity Tests: Performs DHCP and DNS checks to ensure network functionality.
	•	Authentication Method Detection: Identifies the Wi-Fi authentication protocol in use (e.g., WPA3, WPA2).
	•	Automatic Reporting: Generates and saves a summary report with graphical analysis at the end of the monitoring session.
	•	Customizable: Default network interface and other parameters can be adjusted for specific needs.

Installation

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
pip install matplotlib reportlab

Usage

Run the script using Python 3:

sudo python3 wificheck301024.py

During Execution

	•	The script displays a real-time table of Wi-Fi performance metrics.
	•	To stop the analysis, press CTRL+C.

After Execution

	•	A summary report is displayed in the terminal.
	•	A detailed PDF report with graphical analysis is saved in the report/ directory.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	matplotlib for graph generation
	•	reportlab for PDF report creation
	•	wpa_cli for Wi-Fi status commands
	•	iw for Wi-Fi information gathering
	•	ping utility for latency checks
	•	Network interface wlan0 (modifiable in the code)

Report Details

	•	Summary: Includes average signal strength, SNR, data rate, throughput, ping times, and the number of successful, poor, and failed tests.
	•	Graphical Visualization: Line graphs showing variations in signal strength, SNR, and ping times over the monitoring period.

Customization

	•	Modify the interface variable in the auth_check and get_wifi_info functions to use a different network interface.
	•	Change ping targets in gateway_check and internet_check for different network environments.

Kodunuzda kullanılan kütüphaneleri belirledim. Gerekli kütüphaneler ve bunların sudo apt install komutuyla yüklenmesi için aşağıdaki listeyi oluşturabilirsiniz:
	1.	subprocess, re, time, socket, os, datetime, statistics – Bunlar Python’ın yerleşik kütüphaneleridir; ayrıca yükleme gerektirmezler.
	2.	matplotlib – Grafik çizimi için kullanılan kütüphane.
	3.	reportlab – PDF oluşturma için kullanılan kütüphane.

Bu kütüphaneleri yüklemek için terminalde şu komutları çalıştırabilirsiniz:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib python3-reportlab
Bu komutlarla matplotlib ve reportlab kütüphanelerini yükleyerek, kodunuzu sanal ortam kullanmadan çalıştırabilirsiniz. ￼
